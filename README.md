# jenkins-shared-libraries

Collective folder for all Jenkins libraries. Note that unfortunately, different libraries have to be created in jenkins for different purposes.
However, they can all use the same git URL provided that they have diffent folders in the git repo that match their names in the jenkins library configuraiton.
